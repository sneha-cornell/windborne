To address this and create features suitable for ML, I need to ensure the DataFrame contains data with consecutive points for at least some balloon IDs. Given the previous code loaded 3000 entries into `all_balloon_data`, I will use a larger batch size to increase the chance of having multiple entries per balloon ID after sorting. I will then re-apply the feature engineering steps: calculate `delta_lat`, `delta_lon`, `time_diff`, and `displacement`, and handle the resulting NaNs.\n",

        "*   **Predicting Wind Fields:** Build a model to predict wind speed and direction at unobserved locations or future times based on historical balloon positions and weather data. This could be a core ML problem.\n",
        "*   **Identifying Anomalies:** Detect unusual balloon behavior that might not be explained by local wind conditions, potentially indicating other atmospheric phenomena or balloon-specific issues.\n",

        "## Dynamic Updating\n",
